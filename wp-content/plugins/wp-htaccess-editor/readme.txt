If your hosting does not allow you to create or modify files on the server, use another (better) hosting :)

You probably have a syntax error in the file or on the server you are not allowed any of the settings in your htaccess file.
Try to restore the original backup file. If restoration is not possible with this plugin, restore the backup file from the folder "wp-content " manually.
