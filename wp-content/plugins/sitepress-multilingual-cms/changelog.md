#3.1.1

##Fixes
* Fixed an issue that occurs with some configurations, when reading WPML settings

#3.1

##Performances
* Reduced number of queries to one per request when retrieving Admin language
* Reduced the number of calls to *$sitepress->get_current_language()*, *$this->get_active_languages()* and *$this->get_default_language()*, to avoid running the same queries more times than needed
* Dramatically reduced the amount of queries ran when checking if content is properly translated in several back-end pages
* A lot of data is now cached, further reducing queries

##Improvements
* Improved javascript code style
* Orphan content is now checked when (re)activating the plugin, rather than in each request on back-end side
* If languages tables are incomplete, it will be possible to restore them

##Feature
* When setting a value for "This is a translation of", and the current content already has translations in other languages, each translation gets properly synchronized, as long as there are no conflicts. In case of conflicts, translation won't be synchronized, while the current content will be considered as not linked to an original (in line with the old behavior)
* Categories, tags and taxonomies templates files don't need to be translated anymore (though you can still create a translated file). Taxonomy templates will follow this hierarchy: '{taxonomy}-{lang}-{term_slug}-{lang}.php', '{taxonomy}-{term_slug}-{lang}.php', '{taxonomy}-{lang}-{term_slug}-2.php', '{taxonomy}-{term_slug}-2.php', '{taxonomy}-{lang}.php', '{taxonomy}.php'
* Administrators can now edit content that have been already sent to translators
* Ability to set, in the post edit page, an orphan post as source of translated post
* Added WPML capabilities (see online documentation)
* Add support to users with corrupted settings

##Security
* Improved security by using *$wpdb->prepare()* wherever is possible
* Database dump in troubleshooting page is now available to *admin* and *super admin* users only

* Translated static front-page with pagination won't loose the template anymore when clicking on pages
* Reactivating WPML after having added content, will properly set the default language to the orphan content
* SSL support is now properly handled in WPML->Languages and when setting a domain per language
